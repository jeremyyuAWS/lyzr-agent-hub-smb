## **13. Assumptions & Open Questions**
- Do all agents share a common credit pool? *(TBD)*  
- Should MSPs receive revenue share per SI usage? *(Pricing team decision)*  
- On-premise deployment required for regulated industries? *(Roadmap)*  
- Can SMBs override branding? *(Limited to email footers)*  
- Who owns GDPR data-subject access process? *(Legal team)*
